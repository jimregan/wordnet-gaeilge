<p>
This is the home page for <i>An Teasáras Leictreonach</i>,
a free Irish language thesaurus in hypertext PDF
which we believe to be
the first machine-readable monolingual thesaurus 
in a minority language.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are nearly 75,000 entries representing 40,000 unique 
words or phrases, organized into approximately 1000 main headings,
similar to Roget's English language thesaurus.
<li>For maximum portability across computing platforms and to ensure
high quality printed versions, the thesaurus will be distributed in 
<a href = "http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/adobepdf.html">Portable Document Format (PDF)</a>.
<li>Hypertext cross references can be used to navigate the 
thesaurus using the free <a href = "http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>.
<li>Bibliographical sources are provided for each word.
<li>The thesaurus is released under the 
<a href = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.  
This means,
in short, that you have the freedom to copy and redistribute
the thesaurus, with or without modifying it, 
as long as you do so under the same license.
<li>Full <a href = "http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> 
source is available, making customization very easy.
For instance, you can typeset using <i lang="ga">seanchló</i> by downloading 
the appropriate fonts.
<li>We expect to provide frequent updates, 
incorporating corrections and refinements,
but also reflecting Irish as a living language via new terminology,
shifting usages, etc.
<li>The database used to generate the thesaurus is the same one we use
to generate the <a href="http://www.gaelspell.com/">GaelSpell</a> 
family of spellcheckers.  Improvements to
one product will be reflected in the other automatically.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Contributing">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>
The thesaurus is the <em>unedited</em> output of a sequence of
complicated computer algorithms which transforms the underlying
lexicographical database into the final typeset form.
This facilitates change since one need only update the
underlying database and the change should manifest itself
properly in the finished product.   We have found, however,
that the algorithms are far from perfect and substantial
human assistance will be needed to refine
the separation of senses within entries.     Please write
