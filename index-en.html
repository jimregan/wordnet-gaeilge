<p>
This is the home page for <i>Líonra Séimeantach Gaeilge</i>
(the "LSG", or in English, the
<i>Irish Language Semantic Network</i>), a database consisting of 
Irish words and the semantic relationships among them.
A semantic network of this kind is sometimes called a <i>WordNet</i>,
after Princeton's
<a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">English-language WordNet</a>,
which was the first full-scale semantic network
(dating back to the early 1980's).
</p>
<p>
Semantic networks have many applications in Natural Language Processing.
They are used for 
Examples too.
From an artificial intelligence perspective, a semantic network encodes some
of the "real-world knowledge" that is required for computers to understand
non-trivial texts.

<h2><a name="Access">Access</a></h2>
Even if you are not interested in developing software, the database
can still be quite useful, and for this reason we are offering access to
the data in several different ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional Thesaurus in PDF, with hyperlink cross-references.
<li>Integrated into the free <a href="http://ga.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> office suite.
<li>Three-dimensional network browser at <a href="http://www.aimsigh.com/lsg/">aimsigh.com</a>.
<li>In RDF-XML format, for use in other applications.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Big
<li>Open Source, like Princeton, but unlike every other WordNet in existence.
All data, including the PDF thesaurus, are released under the <a href = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.  This means, in short, that you have the freedom to copy and redistribute the data, with or without modifcation, as long as you do so under the same license.
<li>Linked to English WordNet.
<li>We expect to provide frequent updates, 
incorporating corrections and refinements,
but also reflecting Irish as a living language via new terminology,
shifting usages, etc.
<li>The database used to generate the thesaurus is the same one we use
to generate the <a href="http://www.gaelspell.com/">GaelSpell</a> 
family of spellcheckers and the
<a href="http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/">Gramadóir</a> grammar checker.
Improvements to one project will be reflected in the others automatically.
